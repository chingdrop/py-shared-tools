"""Crash-safe, idempotent local file writes: write-to-temp-then-rename, and
directory creation that never fails just because the directory already
exists.

A plain ``path.write_text(...)``/``write_bytes(...)`` is not atomic: a
crash, kill, or concurrent reader mid-write can observe a truncated or
half-written file. ``atomic_write`` avoids that by writing to a private temp
file in ``path``'s own parent directory, then ``os.replace``-ing it into
place — a same-filesystem rename, which POSIX (and Windows, since Python
3.3) guarantees is atomic — so a reader only ever sees the old complete file
or the new complete file, never something in between. Re-running the same
write again produces the same end state, which is the "idempotent" half of
the name.

``ensure_dir`` is the directory-creation counterpart: ``exist_ok=True`` by
construction, so a caller never needs its own "does this already exist"
branch before creating a directory it's about to write into.

Stdlib-only, no third-party dependency.
