"""S3-compatible object storage — a small, dependency-minimal wrapper around
boto3 built around one specific pattern: hand an untrusted or low-trust
caller a short-lived, single-object presigned PUT URL instead of a standing
storage credential, then fetch/clean up the result with your own real
credentials. Requires the ``storage`` extra (``boto3``) — everything else in
this package works without it.

Built against the S3 API, not a specific product: point ``endpoint_url`` at a
self-hosted MinIO instance for local/dev use, or leave it unset to talk to
real AWS S3 in production — same class, same code, just different config.
This is *not* Azure Blob Storage capable: Azure Blob doesn't speak the S3
API, so supporting it would mean a second implementation with a different
SDK (``azure-storage-blob``), not just different credentials on this one.
