"""Generic vendor-API "connector" base: credentialed HTTP plus an optional
push-a-script-and-run-it-remotely capability (SentinelOne's Remote Script
Orchestration, Carbon Black's Live Response, ...) — shared across projects
that talk to the same kind of EDR/security-console vendor APIs.

Live/fixture mode is a first-class fork here, not a test-only shim: when a
connector has no usable credentials (``is_live`` is false), every public
method is expected to fall back to canned fixture data instead of raising —
that's what lets a fresh checkout run a full pipeline with zero live API
access. What "canned data" actually looks like (file naming, any
post-processing) is project-specific, so it is delegated to hook methods each
consumer's own subclass implements — this module only owns the parts that are
identical regardless of what a connector fetches: credential-gated dispatch,
the shared ``RestAdapter`` session, polling, and the vendor registry.

Not every vendor's real API exposes "run an arbitrary script on a managed
endpoint" — subclasses set ``supports_remote_execution = False`` when it
doesn't; ``deploy_and_run`` refuses outright in that case, in both live and
fixture mode, so a consuming pipeline can't accidentally attribute a
capability to a vendor that doesn't really have it.
