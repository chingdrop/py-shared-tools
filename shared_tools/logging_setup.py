"""Idempotent console logging setup for CLI scripts.

``logging.basicConfig()`` is *supposed* to be a no-op after the first call,
but that guard only looks at the root logger's own handler list — it does
nothing to stop a script from calling it once directly and a library it
imports from calling it again on a differently-named logger, or from a
script's own ``main()`` running twice in the same process (a test suite
importing and invoking it more than once, a REPL re-run). Either produces
the classic symptom: every log line printed two or three times, once per
handler that got attached. ``setup_logging`` avoids that by marking the
logger it configures; a second call against the *same* logger object is a
no-op for handler attachment, even though it still updates the level (so a
caller can cheaply re-invoke this just to raise/lower verbosity without
worrying about handler duplication).

Stdlib-only, no third-party dependency.
