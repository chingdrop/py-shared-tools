"""``${VAR}`` secret resolution for YAML-based configs, and the shared
S3-compatible object-storage config shape those configs commonly declare.

Every consumer of this module follows the same convention: a committed
``config.yaml`` holds topology/tuning, with every secret value written as a
``${VAR}`` reference; ``.env`` / the process environment holds the actual
values. A ``${VAR}`` pointing at an *unset* environment variable resolves to
``None`` — deliberately not an error, since "no credentials configured" is a
valid state each consumer uses to fall back to a fixture/offline mode
(agent-parity's connectors, credential-audit's HIBP client). This module is
the one place that resolution rule is implemented; each consumer's own
``config.py`` still owns its own ``AppConfig`` shape and section parsing.

``StorageConfig``/``parse_storage_config``/``get_storage`` are the same
addition for the object-storage handoff both ``agent-parity`` and
``credential-audit`` use (see ``shared_tools.script_export``) — the config
shape and the "build an ``ObjectStorage`` or ``None``" logic were
byte-for-byte identical in both projects' own ``config.py`` before this was
extracted; each consumer's own ``AppConfig`` still embeds ``StorageConfig``
and calls these directly, it just no longer redefines them.
