"""SentinelOne Remote Script Orchestration (RSO) mixin.

Shared by any project's ``SentinelOneConnector`` that needs to push and run a
script via SentinelOne's RSO API — ``agent-parity``'s AD-export collection and
``credential-audit``'s AD-metadata collection both do the exact same upload ->
execute -> poll -> fetch-files sequence against the exact same endpoints, so
it lives here once rather than twice.

Shaped after the Management Console API v2.1 (public docs). Mix this in
alongside whatever project-specific base a connector needs — e.g.
``class SentinelOneConnector(SentinelOneRSOMixin, AgentConnector)`` — the
concrete class still sets its own ``vendor``/``required_credentials`` and
whatever else its own project needs (inventory fetching, or nothing at all);
this mixin provides only the RSO mechanics and assumes whatever it's mixed
into also provides ``shared_tools.remote_exec.VendorConnector``'s
``credentials``/``_request_json``/``_request``/``_as_text``/``_poll_until``.

        defines itself but which other methods here reach via ``self`` just

        member and a ``ClassVar`` implementation as structurally
        incompatible, which silently breaks self-type matching for every
