"""Storage-backed script export: run a script via a
:class:`~shared_tools.remote_exec.VendorConnector` and return its output,
preferring a presigned-upload-URL handoff through object storage over
trusting the connector's own remote-execution output channel.

Shared by any project that pushes a script to a vendor-managed endpoint and
needs the result back verbatim — SentinelOne RSO's fetch-files and Carbon
Black Live Response's command output don't reliably preserve exact
formatting (encoding, line-ending normalization) and have real output-size
limits, so a live run instead hands the script a short-lived presigned PUT
URL (:class:`shared_tools.storage.ObjectStorage`) and fetches the real
output with a plain GET; the connector call's own return value is discarded
entirely. Fixture mode (a non-live connector) never touches storage at all —
there's no real endpoint to upload anything from.

``agent-parity``'s AD-export collection and ``credential-audit``'s
AD-metadata collection both had byte-for-byte identical versions of this
orchestration before it moved here — the only real differences were the
object-key prefix, the CSV header column checked as a sanity check, and the
error-message wording, all parameterized below rather than hardcoded.
