"""Extension-dispatch tabular file I/O: read or write a DataFrame as CSV,
Excel, JSON, or HTML based on the file's extension, without the caller
picking the right pandas reader/writer method itself.

Extracted from ``vega-tools``' ``pandas_tools.read_structured_file``/
``write_structured_file`` — generic plumbing with nothing to do with that
project's own domain (DICOM/medical imaging), while ``agent-parity``'s
``cli.py`` (``_write_csv``, hardcoded to CSV) and ``medicare-rebuild``'s
``__main__.py`` (``snap_dataframe``, hardcoded to Excel) each hand-rolled a
narrower slice of the same "get a DataFrame onto/off of disk" job.

Two changes from the original: this raises :class:`TabularIOError` instead
of printing and returning ``None``/``False`` (matching every other typed
exception in this package — ``ConfigError``, ``StorageError``,
``ConnectorError``, ...), and text-based formats (csv/txt/json/html) are
written through :func:`shared_tools.atomic_io.atomic_write` rather than
pandas' own ``to_csv``/etc. writing directly to the target path — the same
"a plain ``to_csv(path)`` isn't atomic" reasoning agent-parity's own
``_write_csv`` already used. Excel has no equivalent in-memory-string
round trip as cheap as the text formats', so it's written directly and is
not atomic.

Requires the ``tabular`` extra (``pandas``, ``openpyxl`` for ``.xls``/
``.xlsx``); everything else in this package works without it.
